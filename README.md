About Me

Name: Brandon Henderson
Hometown: AMITYVILLE, NY, USA

Prior IT Experience:
While I don’t have formal IT experience yet, I’ve always been interested in technology and how it shapes our world. My work in security and as a mobile barber has taught me to think critically, adapt quickly, and communicate effectively. Skills that I know will transfer well into the IT and cybersecurity fields. My curiosity about how digital systems work and how to protect them from threats is what led me to pursue this path.

Career Plans:
After completing the cybersecurity course, my goal is to land a role as a Security Analyst or SOC Analyst. I’m passionate about building a stable, long term career in cybersecurity and eventually working in sectors like healthcare or finance, where protecting sensitive data is critical. I’m also focused on building generational wealth and creating a legacy, so this career shift is part of a bigger mission to change my bloodline’s trajectory.

Proud Project/Task:
One project I’m proud of is building my own mobile barbering business from the ground up. It taught me discipline, time management, and how to deal with people from all walks of life. I’ve been cutting hair for 17 years, and what makes this experience stand out is how I’ve been able to turn a skill into a dependable source of income while supporting my family and maintaining strong customer relationships.
